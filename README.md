# SoftwareSecurity

The client, Atermis Financial, provides consulting services in the form of financial plans for customers.  They hired us to assess their security posture and provide guidance on how to protect their systems and customer data.  Some tangible goals that embody this intention are adding file verification steps via checksums and creating website certificates to ensure encryption. 

Using the dependency check tool was something that I did well.  Going through and reading all the solutions and then applying them was very satisfying and helpful because it showed that there are many libraries out there that can enable developers to create applications but it's important to remember that these libraries are also just code that needs to be maintained.  Maintained code can withstand all the newly discovered vulnerabilities.  Overall security in code can increase performance, stability and customer confidence. 

Cautious error handling and input validation were the two layers of security that were implemented in the RESTful side of code while dependency checks were run across the libraries and plugins to ensure that there were no glaring vulnerabilities.  

Rigorous testing of the code by adding different inputs and launching on different consoles was key to making sure that functionality was stable.  Dependency checks and code review were executed to ensure security of said code. 

Other dependency check tools and dynamic tools that can operate at runtime would be helpful in making the code even more secure. 

I would showcase the experience with troubleshooting and commented sections within the code that show the logical thought processes of troubleshooting throughout the dependency check.  Also the ability to read the CVE comments and follow the path to resolutions.
